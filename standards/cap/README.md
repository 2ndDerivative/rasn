# Common Alerting Protocol
This crate provides an implementation of the data types for [X.1303](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Emergency-Telecommunications/Documents/2020/T-REC-X.1303bis-201403-.pdf), also
known as Common Alerting Protocol (CAP).

Like other `rasn` core crates, this doesn't provide a CAP client or server
but provides the core data types used to be able to create your own clients
and servers.
